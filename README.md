# Lightning Search
A command line program that can search any file within few milliseconds no matter how many files exits or how large the contents of the file.

## How to Use?
download the quickSearch.c program and compile it using a C compiler like gcc/clang<br>
-> first run the .exe file with this argument: index-file. This will index all the file names in it.<br>
->now run the file with the file name you want to see if it exists. You need to exactly type the name of the file. like if file name is file1.txt and you type File1.txt it may not work.

## Note:
This program may say that a file may exist even though it doesn't but it will never say a program doesn't exist when it does.
